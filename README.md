Romanian Monetary Dynamics (RMD) is an accounting-constrained empirical stock-flow-consistent dynamic model of Romania's monetary and macro-financial system, under development toward an endogenous System Dynamics reference model. The current core has SD-compatible stocks, flows, conservation rules and a candidate feedback architecture, but behavioural closure is inactive and RMD is not yet a complete endogenous System Dynamics model. The repository contains the accounting and dynamics engine, empirical and calibration/validation contracts, source and processed data with provenance and the scripts directly required to obtain or assess those model inputs. It is maintained as a scientific model core rather than an end-user application.

**Current scientific status:** the Validation Recovery / Empirical Basis Expansion stage has completed its currently admissible work and the repository is in **Evidence-Triggered Baseline Hold**. This is not model completion: integrated reference-mode readiness remains 9/10, no behavioural reference mechanism is validated, no calibration/refit cycle is open, and behavioural closure remains inactive. New empirical work requires a declared source, identification, accounting or prospective-event reopen trigger. See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for the current scientific boundary and [CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff) for citation metadata.

**Release/version state:** the latest public scientific-core release remains **v0.1.0**. `main` contains unreleased scientific-integrity and reproducibility work; the next public scientific-core release candidate is **v0.2.0**, but no new release is implied merely by ongoing development. Version changes are governed atomically by [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md): package metadata, README badge, citation metadata/date, changelog, Git tag and GitHub Release must identify the same release.
